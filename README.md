# C/C++ and OOP

This is a repository to save the exercises I did to practice C/C++  
Also here are some exercises to OOP class and studies.

# SDLearning2

To be able to build and run programs in SDLearning2 folder, you need to  
open terminal in this folder, run `mingw32-make -f Makefile`,  
then open the **.exe** double clicking it or `start (filename).exe`  
For default, those will build **main.cpp** and open **main.exe**  


If you want to build a **.cpp** file with another name, like **whatever.cpp**  
you need to modify **Makefile** parameters so it can build your file.
